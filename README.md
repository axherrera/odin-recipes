# odin-recipes
This project will serve as the capstone for the html section of The Odin Projec
foundations module. In this project, I will be building a small website with 
html that will display a list of recipes to the visitors. This list will be
composed of hyperlinks that link to a page dedicates to the recipes they
are named after. Once I have finished this project, I will have demonstrated my proficiency with html boilerplate, headers, links, images, git, and file 
structure.
